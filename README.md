This is Raven, a spotify clone I made with my 3 friends for my Database course's project. It uses phpmyadmin and has triggers and hashes passwords in the registration and stores them in hashed form.
You can listen to music make playlists and view artists and albums of the songs. Currently there is only one song to make the file size smaller.
